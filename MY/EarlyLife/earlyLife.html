				<h1>Early Life</h1>
				
				<p>
					Malala Yousafzai was born on July 12th 1997, in Mingora, Pakistan. She was named Malala, after Malalai, the famous Pashtun heroine. In 2009, Malala began writing an anonymous blog for the BBC under the penname Gul Makai to express her views on education and life under the threat of the Taliban taking over her valley. "When the Taliban came to Swat they banned women from going to the market and they banned shopping," Malala told the BBC last year. But Malala's primary objection was to the Taliban's prohibition of female education. Militants had destroyed over 150 schools in 2008 alone. Malala Yousafzai was one of the few brave voices to speak out. A climate of fear prevailed and Malala and her father began to receive death threats for their outspoken views. As a consequence, Malala and her father began to fear for their safety. In 2011, she received Pakistan’s first National Youth Peace Prize and she was nominated by Archbishop Desmond Tutu for the International Children’s Peace Prize. Her increased profile and strident criticism of the Taliban caused Taliban leaders to meet, and in 2012, they voted to kill her.  Malala’s father is a poet who runs a school and believes in educational rights as well; her father had received threats from the Taliban as well. In 2008, the Taliban had destroyed over 150 schools. In 2009, Malala Yousafazi, who was twelve years old at the time, started blogging for the BBC, about living with the Taliban’s threats to deny her education. She tried to hide her identity, however her real name was revealed in December of 2009. She gained more speakers and continued to blog with the BBC. When she was fourteen years old, her family found out that she was being target by the Taliban, but they thought that the Taliban would not actually harm children.

				<h2>Terror Strikes</h2>

					On 9 October, 2012, a masked gunman entered her school bus and asked for Malala by name. Malala was shot with a single bullet which went through her head, neck and shoulder. Malala survived the initial shooting, but was in a critical condition.

				<h2>Recovery</h2>
				
				<p>
					Doctors in a military hospital in Pakistan removed the bullet from her neck, along with a piece of her skull to ease the swelling. She was then put in a medically induced coma and taken to Great Britain to receive more treatment. Malala was unresponsive for three days. A little bit after a week of being shot, she was able to stand while leaning on a nurse’s shoulder and wrote on pieces of paper because she was not able to talk again yet. Malala even asked her father to bring school books from Pakistan so that she could study. About four weeks later, she was able to read, write, and talk. Malala was discharged from the hospital in January 2013 and continued therapy at home. In February 2013, after regaining her strength, she had more surgeries to fix her hearing in her left ear and repair her skull.
