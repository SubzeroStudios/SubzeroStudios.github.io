				<h1>Famous Quotes</h1>
					“Dear friends, on the 9th of October, 2012, the Taliban shot me on the left side of my forehead. They shot my friends too. They thought that the bullets would silence us, but they failed.”
				<p></p>

			
					“I speak not for myself but for those without a voice- those who have fought for their right to live in peace, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated.”
				<p></p>

				
					“One child, one teacher, one pen, and one book can change the world.”
				<p></p>

			
					"At the end, the villain loses and the hero wins, and there is a happy ending,"
				<p></p>
			
					"The girls were not too excited about vacations because they knew if the Taliban implemented their edict [banning girls' education] they would not be able to come to school again. I am of the view that the school will one day reopen but while leaving I looked at the building as if I would not come here again." –Written In January 2009
